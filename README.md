# Tic Tac Toe Game


## Project Overview
This is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game designed for two players X and O, featuring a clean and responsive design. Players alternate between placing X and O on a 3x3 grid, with the game determining the winner based on standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules. The game also includes a scoreboard, player turn indicator, and a play again option. Additionally, there’s a custom 404 error page for handling non-existent pages.
